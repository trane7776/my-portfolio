    content: |-
      I am an enthusiastic software developer with a strong passion for both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies. With a solid background in computer science and mathematics, I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and innovation. Despite not having formal work experience, I have been actively engaged in freelance projects that showcase my skills and dedication.

      My expertise includes building sophisticated single-page applications (SPA) using modern frameworks and developing secure, efficient blockchain-based websites. I have hands-on experience with Next.js, Solidity, smart contract testing, and the Ethers.js library. Additionally, I am proficient in integrating and using MetaMask for decentralized applications.

      As a freelancer, I have successfully completed multiple projects that required me to leverage my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to deliver high-quality solutions. I am committed to continuing my growth and contributing to innovative projects in the web development space.
